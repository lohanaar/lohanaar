## About Me

I'm Lohana, a determined and resilient individual with a strong foundation in Statistics, having earned my degree from the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) in 2019. My journey into the world of data began in 2013, driven by my aptitude for mathematics and a recommendation from my high school math teacher. Throughout my time at university, I faced several personal challenges and a significant strike that extended my studies, but I never gave up on my passion for data.

During my academic years, I gained practical experience through various internships:

- **Kinoplex:** Supported the Marketing department with data entry and budget control, collaborated with the finance team, and participated in strategy meetings.
- **SENAC:** Collected socioeconomic indicators, created and analyzed charts, generated reports for senior management, and debugged data in Excel.
- **Hemorio:** Conducted customer satisfaction surveys, performed statistical analysis, and prepared reports using SPSS and Excel.

I particularly enjoyed courses such as Consumer Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, and Linear Regression, which solidified my interest in data analysis.

In 2020, I embarked on a cultural exchange in Ireland to enhance my English communication skills. Between 2020 and 2022, I worked in various sectors, gaining unique insights into consumer perspectives. This experience enriched my understanding and provided a diverse background that I believe is invaluable in data analysis.

Currently, I work as an Executive Specialist at Infosys BPM, where I analyze contracts, ensure compliance, and audit orders, gaining a solid business perspective. Alongside my job, I am honing my skills in SQL, Python, and R, and am enrolled in the Postgraduate Certificate in Fundamentals of Data Science program at TU Dublin.

This portfolio showcases the projects I am developing as I pursue a career in Data Science. I invite you to explore my work and connect with me for potential collaborations or opportunities.
